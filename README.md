#### Usage

#### Why use Git for manuscripts?
 -  Single files: using git simplifies things as there's only a single version of a manuscript.  
 -  Merging: if two people work on the same file at the same time, they can be merged without much issue.  
 -  Simplified "diff" documents: can also use latexdiff-vc (latexdiff with version control) to make pdf files similar to Word documents with "Track Changes".  
 -  Easier collaboration: No need to email files back and forth.
